But this last time the spectacular service of Kayla made me have to write a review. As I said, I’ve loved this place for years, good food, good service, and tonight I called them with 30 minutes to close and was met with the warm, personable, and helpful Kayla. She answered the phone and took my order like the restaurant wasn’t shutting down for the night. When I went to pick up my food, she was as welcoming and personable as she was on the phone.
